The assumption is that costs of these things will continue to decline exponentially without limit indefinitely into the future.  From the “Results” section: “We know of no empirical evidence supporting floor costs and do not impose them . . . “   Of the three technologies at issue (wind, solar, and batteries), the one I know the most about is batteries.  Here is the Way, et al., chart of price history of batteries and the projection they use for the future:<p>...<p>As to continuing rapid declines in the prices of wind turbines and solar panels, I’ll believe it when I see it.  Yes there have been substantial declines to date.  But at this point these strike me as mature technologies.  The main issues in getting them built and operational are mining and processing huge quantities of metals and minerals, forming the metals and minerals into the devices, transporting the (very large and heavy) devices to their sites, and installing them.  How are those things going to get cheaper by any substantial amount, let alone another order of magnitude?<p>The treatment of the energy storage problem in this paper is wholly inadequate, and bordering on the fantastical.  The cost fantasies as to short-term storage are discussed above.  As to longer term storage, from the Supplemental Information, pages 38-45, it appears that the proposed solution is almost entirely hydrogen, supposedly to be produced by electrolysis from water.  (Here, they mostly.call the proposed storage medium “P2X fuels,” somehow implying that it might be something other than hydrogen, much like with New York and its “DEFR” fantasy.).  There is currently essentially no existing prototype or demonstration project of this so-called “green hydrogen” anywhere in the world from which realistic cost projections can be derived.  (From the 2022 JP Morgan Asset Management Annual Energy Paper, page 39: “Current green hydrogen production is negligible. . . .”). Way, et al., do cite some costs of existing electrolyzers, but I can find no discussion in the paper of the issue that producing hydrogen on a scale sufficient to back up the entire world electricity system is going to require electrolyzing the ocean.  And the millions of tons of toxic chlorine gas thereby produced are going to go — where?  The problems of dealing with enormous amounts of hydrogen — like explosiveness, embrittlement of pipelines, and the like — are dealt with with a wave of the hand.  The creation of a massive green hydrogen infrastructure as the backup for wind and sun hasn’t even been begun by the most fanatical of the green energy crazies like Germany, California or New York.

Notable customers include Sam Smith, Dixie D&#x27;Amelio, Kodak Black, Miles Teller, The Black Keys, and the Friends With Benefits DAO.<p>We&#x27;ve also established strategic partnerships with companies including Acast (podcast distribution), Fevo (sports and entertainment ticketing), Sound.xyz (music NFTs), Hoo.be (link-in-bio), CD Baby (music distribution), and Voice.com (NFT art collectibles). In the last year, we&#x27;ve rolled out integrations with Instagram, Spotify and some of the largest Web3 Wallet providers.<p>As a product engineer, writing code and building beautiful user experiences is just one part of your job. You&#x27;ll also talk to users, get involved with design, and develop your own opinion on what needs to exist in the world. Then you&#x27;ll move with urgency to make it happen.<p>What will you do?<p>You&#x27;ll work with a small engineering team to build mission-critical tools for creators.<p>As one of our first engineers, you&#x27;ll build entirely new products from scratch and make important architectural decisions.<p>You&#x27;ll be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing entire projects end to end, from idea to launch. To do so, you&#x27;ll have to work closely with design, operations, and (of course) creators.<p>You&#x27;ll help build the foundation for Laylo engineering standards, tooling, and processes.<p>Creators are the most visual people on the planet -- you&#x27;ll build a user experience that is both visually stunning and easy-to-use.<p>As we grow, we&#x27;ll build up an engineering team around you.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who:<p>Cares about creators and wants to build something meaningful. The tools we create will empower the next generation of entrepreneurs, and we take that responsibility seriously.\nEnjoys all aspects of building a product from scratch. You love talking to customers just as much as making technical decisions.<p>Understands the importance of both speed and quality, and the trade-offs of choosing one over the other.<p>Has 3+ years experience with frontend development, preferably with hands-on experience with React, Typescript, and Apollo\nFamiliarity with mobile responsive design and component architecture are a plus<p>Wants to join a tight-knit team -- we work on solutions as a whole engineering team. If you love working on the end-to-end product experience, you&#x27;ll love working here.<p>About Us:<p>Our founders met while building competing consumer startups. We’ve launched multiple products across consumer and SaaS and talked to thousands of fans and creators in the process. In 2020, we realized one of the biggest pain points creators have is reaching and managing their fanbase directly.<p>We went through Y Combinator in summer 2020 while building that new product and after seeing really strong early traction, raised our seed round in mid 2021.<p>Right now we&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s based in Los Angeles but working from home. We&#x27;re hiring remotely in North America.<p>We have a strong written documentation culture, leveraging Notion to share ideas and record processes and learnings.

We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay.

We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience.

We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub.', 0, '', NULL),

We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company.

In 2020, we realized one of the biggest pain points creators have is reaching and managing their fanbase directly.<p>We went through Y Combinator in summer 2020 while building that new product and after seeing really strong early traction, raised our seed round in mid 2021.<p>Right now we&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s based in Los Angeles but working from home. We&#x27;re hiring remotely in North America.<p>We have a strong written documentation culture, leveraging Notion to share ideas and record processes and learnings. We try to do as much as possible asynchronously to move quickly and efficiently.', 0, '', NULL),

We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience.

We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company.

We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start.

Notable customers include Sam Smith, Dixie D&#x27;Amelio, Kodak Black, Miles Teller, The Black Keys, and the Friends With Benefits DAO.<p>We&#x27;ve also established strategic partnerships with companies including Acast (podcast distribution), Fevo (sports and entertainment ticketing), Sound.xyz (music NFTs), Hoo.be (link-in-bio), CD Baby (music distribution), and Voice.com (NFT art collectibles). In the last year, we&#x27;ve rolled out integrations with Instagram, Spotify and some of the largest Web3 Wallet providers.<p>As a product engineer, writing code and building beautiful user experiences is just one part of your job. You&#x27;ll also talk to users, get involved with design, and develop your own opinion on what needs to exist in the world. Then you&#x27;ll move with urgency to make it happen.<p>What will you do?<p>You&#x27;ll work with a small engineering team to build mission-critical tools for creators.<p>As one of our first engineers, you&#x27;ll build entirely new products from scratch and make important architectural decisions.<p>You&#x27;ll be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing entire projects end to end, from idea to launch. To do so, you&#x27;ll have to work closely with design, operations, and (of course) creators.<p>You&#x27;ll help build the foundation for Laylo engineering standards, tooling, and processes.<p>Creators are the most visual people on the planet -- you&#x27;ll build a user experience that is both visually stunning and easy-to-use.<p>As we grow, we&#x27;ll build up an engineering team around you.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who:<p>Cares about creators and wants to build something meaningful. The tools we create will empower the next generation of entrepreneurs, and we take that responsibility seriously.\nEnjoys all aspects of building a product from scratch. You love talking to customers just as much as making technical decisions.<p>Understands the importance of both speed and quality, and the trade-offs of choosing one over the other.<p>Has 3+ years experience with frontend development, preferably with hands-on experience with React, Typescript, and Apollo\nFamiliarity with mobile responsive design and component architecture are a plus<p>Wants to join a tight-knit team -- we work on solutions as a whole engineering team. If you love working on the end-to-end product experience, you&#x27;ll love working here.<p>About Us:<p>Our founders met while building competing consumer startups. We’ve launched multiple products across consumer and SaaS and talked to thousands of fans and creators in the process. In 2020, we realized one of the biggest pain points creators have is reaching and managing their fanbase directly.<p>We went through Y Combinator in summer 2020 while building that new product and after seeing really strong early traction, raised our seed round in mid 2021.<p>Right now we&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s based in Los Angeles but working from home. We&#x27;re hiring remotely in North America.<p>We have a strong written documentation culture, leveraging Notion to share ideas and record processes and learnings.

We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start.

We recently graduated college and have been getting more into crypto &#x2F; web3 over the past year.<p>A few of our friends had been getting into crypto more recently, but we noticed that it was hard to actually see what they were doing or natively engage with the transactions they were committing. Products like blockchain.com and etherscan.com were too technical, and products like Context or Zerion lacked key features that make modern products social, such as descriptions, likes, and comments.<p>We built WalletWatch as an easier, more social, and more fun way to see and engage with your friends’ Ethereum activity. We don’t ask for your email or password, and instead authenticate by asking users to sign a transaction with their Ethereum wallet; we ask for usernames to give a more familiar and user-friendly experience for people that haven’t purchased ENS or other crypto domain names. At the moment, we’re storing user data in Firebase instead of on-chain because the current decentralized channels are too expensive or slow.<p>We consider WalletWatch as pre-alpha. The website only renders in a mobile viewport and isn’t totally visually or computationally optimized, because we wanted to see if people liked this thing enough for us to spend more time making it polished.<p>We’d love any feedback you all have!', 'https://walletwatch-frontend.vercel.app/', '', NULL),
